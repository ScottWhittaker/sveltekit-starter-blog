<h2>Welcome to the <span>SvelteKit Blog Starter</span></h2>
<p>Just another starter, there are plenty out there, this one is my attempt.</p>

<h3>Why bother?</h3>
<p>I like <a href="https://svelte.dev/">svelte</a> and thought it was a good opportunity to re-write my own site using this approach.</p>

<h3>Can I use this as a starter for my own site?</h3>
<p>Of course, do what you need to do. Use it as is, modify until you are content, throw it away if you don't like it.</p>

<h2>What does this starter provide?</h2>
<p>It gets you up and running quickly should you want to. Provides a few pages to get you going and a couple of starter <a href="/posts">posts</a> written in markdown for your pleasure.</p>
<p>I have merrily copied/learned from other sources to put this together, nothing original on my part.</p>
